            "Today was my first session with Coach Cham. As an MMA athlete I can honestly say i was pushed. It was a lot of fun however the sessions are challenging and Coach Cham shows his passion and dedication as he is constantly pushing you to do your best. A typpe of coach everyone needs in any type of sport. If you're looking for fun, to get your fitness up or have a passion for the game, sessions with Coach Cham are essential this side of the Midlands."

            My first time training with Coach Cham was an amazing experience. The activities were unexpected and yet so engaging. I thought we were just going to do some running and kicking the ball a bit but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I was pushed to limits in terms of fitness. I would say this was one of the best fitness sessions I've ever had in my life. Coach Cham himself is a breath of fresh air, he's a coach who truly has a passion for what he does and he manages to pass that onto his clients. He makes the sessions fun for all ages kids and adults no matter the skill level.
