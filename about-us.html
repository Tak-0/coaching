        <p class="about-us-p">
            My passion for coaching started when I began taking my younger nieces and nephews out for weekly football and fitness sessions to predominantly help build their confidence, as well as improve their wellbeing & health. During these sessions other children would start to join in, and before we knew it we were managing about 10 or 12 kids in a game of Wembley at the local park ðŸ˜€. <br> <br>
    
            During these sessions we recognised there was a big demand for coaching & development training for the local kids. However, unfortunately we also noticed that there is a lack of opportunity and scarce resources available for those children desiring to train. <br> <br>
    
            We live in challenging times whether it's work, family commitments or any other extenuating factors. It can be quite difficult to consistently take our little ones out for football sessions.

        <p class="about-us-p">Our aim at Fitness with Champions, is to fill in that gap: for those that are desiring to train, get in shape, boost their confidence & social skills; for those that are desiring to improve their footballing abilities to progress onto the highest of stages where they can showcase their abilities.</p>
